# Sample DVC Pipeline Building Project
Data Version Control (DVC) pipeline for machine learning workflows. The project showcases a simple end-to-end pipeline that includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages, all managed using DVC for reproducibility and version control.

### How to Use
- Clone the repository

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run the pipeline: `dvc repro`

- Track changes: `dvc push (if using remote storage)`

The pipeline consists of three stages:

- Data preprocessing `(preprocess.py)`

- Model training `(train.py)`

- Model evaluation `(evaluate.py)`

Each stage is versioned with DVC, allowing for complete reproducibility of the ML workflow.
